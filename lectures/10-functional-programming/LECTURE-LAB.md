## TODOs: MVP

1. Let's make sure each one of our scripts are properly enclosed. Wrap the contents of article.js in an IIFE, just like articleView.js has been. Set up your IIFE so it receives a parameter to which it can attach behavior.  

1. For both `index.html` and `admin.html`, we'll want access to the `Article.all` data...but we'll have different view functions to set up each of those pages. Help complete the `fetchAll` function so that it calls a `next` parameter: a function to invoke when it's work is done.  

1. Ensure both the index page and the admin page call `fetchAll` in a way that properly triggers the appropriate page setup methods.  
1. Use chained map/reduce calls to transform the data into what you need it to be.  


## Stretch Goals:
- What statistical analysis would be of interest to you with this data set? Code it up!

# Portfolio Assignment

Scopes and closures and IIFE's, oh my! :grimacing:

Apply some functional programming concepts to your portfolio codebase.

 - Eliminate all `for` loops.  

 - Use `map` where you are transforming one collection into another.  

 - In at least one place, enclose the contents of a script file in an IIFE, that exports your high-level objects.  

 - Refactor any parts of your app that could be more loosely coupled. Make smaller functions that can accept and expect the  return values of other functions!  

 - Think of a useful way to use `reduce`. Maybe you want to put some "fun facts stats" in your footer?  

## Technical Requirements

- [x] Use of at least one .map() method.
- [x] Use of at least one .reduce() method.
- [x] IIFE present on at least one .js file.
